    <h2>Hi, Im Said Oudouane</h2>
    <p>... and I'm a geek</p>
    <p>Tech is reshaping how we learn and come together.
        Software is ubiquitous and every person can now build their way to a future that inspires them. However,
        today’s world isn’t designed to work for these makers creating an imbalance between the impact they’re capable
        of, and what’s expected of them.
    </p>
    <p>We at <a href="https://www.youcode.ma"><b>YouCode</b></a> learn how to solve this problem...</p>
    <ul>
        <li>By learning best <b>practices</b> at <a href="https://www.youcode.ma"><b>YouCode</b></a> through extensive
            mentoring;
        </li>
        <li>By building <b>communities</b>, and networking with each other through our environment and even through
            events with other schools including
            <a href="https://1337.ma/">1337</a> and other schools;
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>To join us at <b>YouCode</b> you have to go through multiple stages and tests with other students.</p>
    <p>These are the following stages:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Online Test</li>
        <li>Face-To-Face test</li>
        <li>SaS period (3 weeks mentoring with a final project where you show what you learned during this period)</li>
    </ol>
    <p style="color: green; font-weight: bold">after that you get to continue for 2 years mentoring to develop your skills and become a developer.</p>
